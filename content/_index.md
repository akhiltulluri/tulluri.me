# My Journey in Tech

{% detail(title="TL;DR") %}
**At Present**: Going to pursue my Masters at [Northeastern University, Boston](https://northeastern.edu) starting Fall 2024.

Started coding with python in grade 11 (thanks to discord bots!), pursued Bachelors at [VIT-AP](https://vitap.ac.in), interned at multiple startups ([eFuse](https://efuse.gg), [DigitalFortress](https://digitalfortress.in), [Jarobe Labs](https://jarobe.dev)) as _backend/full stack engineer_, interested in _distributed systems, databases and serverless computing_.

{% quote(cite="Arthur Ash") %} Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome. {% end %}

I started programming in 11th grade because of a friend who was building [chatbots on discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). I was intrigued by how they worked, which led me to learn programming and pick up [Python](https://www.python.org). At that time, I had access to a very old sluggish laptop, so I used my Android phone to code -- with help of [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_IN&pli=1).

{% end %}

Later, I joined [VIT Andhra Pradesh](https://vitap.ac.in) for my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm graduating this year. I've always loved building things, whether in my free time, during internships, or at school. I was fortunate to intern at multiple startups ([eFuse](https://efuse.gg), [DigitalFortress](https://digitalfortress.in), [Jarobe Labs](https://jarobe.dev)) as Backend / Full Stack Engineer throughout my bachelors, where I spent a lot of time building and breaking software.

Although I was initially self-taught during grades 11 and 12, pursuing a bachelor's degree helped me learn subjects I wouldn't have otherwise. Now, I'm interested in focusing more on specific parts of CS, particularly _distributed systems, databases, and serverless computing_.

To explore those specific interests and expand my skill set, I'll be pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at [Northeastern University, Boston](https://northeastern.edu) starting Fall 2024.
